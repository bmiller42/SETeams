#Running Ballzy App
##Linux Instructions
Assuming you have followed instructions on https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content
and installed react-native, android studio and created an emulation device then you would do the following.

Open up a terminal and go to the BallzyApp directory.
First off run avd manager by running the following command.


```android avd &```


Press enter to free up terminal.

Avd should start so choose your emulation device or create one.
Start the emulation device.
Make sure you are in the BallzyApp directory and then run the following.


```react-native start &```


press enter again and then run the following


```react-native run-android```

You should see the app start up in the emulation device.

If you have a better process for running app on emulation device let me know.
